**Unit 3: Techniques and Principles of Integration** <span
id="3"></span> 
*Until now, we have been spending the majority of our time on the
integration of relatively simple functions (at least in comparison to
some of the functions we discussed in Part I).  In this unit, we will
learn how to analyze more complex functions using more sophisticated
machinery.  This includes clever methods of substitution, guides to
algebraic simplification, and integration by parts, as well as using
tables of integration or approximating the integral numerically.  We
will also address how to manage integrals where either the integrand is
discontinuous in the domain of integration, or the domain of integration
is infinite.*

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Use integration by parts to compute definite and
    indefinite integrals.
-   Integrate trigonometric functions.
-   Use trigonometric substitution to compute definite and indefinite
    integrals.
-   Use the natural logarithm in substitutions to compute integrals.
-   Integrate rational functions using the method of partial fractions.
-   Compute integrals using integral tables.
-   Approximate integrals using numerical integration techniques
    including the trapezoidal rule and Simpson’s rule.
-   Compute improper integrals of both types.

**3.1 Methods of Integration** <span id="3.1"></span> 
*So far, we have seen two ideas for computing integrals: directly apply
a formula (adjusting for coefficients and using the sum rule to break
apart polynomials and similar); or rewrite the integral in some way,
either by algebraic manipulation or by substitution.  This subunit
expands the number of rewriting techniques at our disposal and adds a
new technique entirely: integration by parts.*  
  
 *Unlike differentiation, integration requires a little more forethought
or “creativity” in certain situations, as the correct implementation of
integration methods is less obvious.  In fact, there are often multiple
correct methods to solve a complicated integral problem, though they may
vary in difficulty.  It may not be clear whether the approach you are
using is correct until you are partway through the problem, so stick out
your attempt until you either succeed or hit an obvious wall.*

**3.1.1 Integration by Parts** <span id="3.1.1"></span> 
*Though this formula may at first seem arbitrary, integration by parts
is merely the product rule in reverse.  With it, we use the information
we have to determine what the initial functions were.  Integration by
parts is useful for integrands that are the product of two functions
from different “families,” such as an exponential with a polynomial.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read Section 7.4
    in its entirety (pages 391 through 395).  Integration by parts is a
    technique used to integrate more complicated combinations of
    functions.  It is easy to derive – simply rearrange the product
    rule!  Careful bookkeeping is essential for mastering this
    technique, so keep plenty of scrap paper on hand, use different
    variables if you have to perform integration by parts a second time
    in the same problem, and be neat.  It will save you time in the
    end.

**3.1.2 Trigonometric Integration** <span id="3.1.2"></span> 
*Trigonometric identities will be used heavily in this and the next
sub-subunit.  If you wish to review trigonometric identities, they are
covered in the first three sections of Unit 3 of Precalculus II*
[(MA003)](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma003/)*.  Pay particular
attention to sin<sup>2</sup> x + cos<sup>2</sup> x = 1 and its
counterparts for tan/sec and cot/csc, the half-angle formulas, and the
double-angle formulas.*  
  
 *Trigonometric integration is a simplification method: if you are asked
to integrate sin<sup>8</sup> x cos x, you can substitute for sin x and
be on your way.  However, the situation is different if cos x also has a
larger exponent.  This sub-subunit covers methods to “whittle down” the
exponents of such a problem until substitution applies.*

**3.1.3 Trigonometric Substitution** <span id="3.1.3"></span> 
*Trigonometric substitution is a particular “inverse substitution”
technique.  In substitution as we have most commonly seen so far, the
new variable is given as a function of the old variable; in inverse
substitution, this relationship is reversed.  In trigonometric
substitution, we let our old variable be a trigonometric function of the
new variable, chosen so the Pythagorean Theorem applies to simplify the
original integrand.  This technique is useful when you have a binomial
you wish were a monomial, typically because your binomial is on the
bottom of a fraction or under a radical.*

**3.1.4 More Techniques Using the Natural Logarithm** <span
id="3.1.4"></span> 
*If y = f(x), then ln y = ln (f(x)).  If f(x) involves powers, products,
or quotients, taking the natural logarithm may allow us to simplify,
making differentiation easier.  On the other hand, the fact that the
integral of du/u is ln u seems only narrowly applicable.  However,
certain functions that do not originally appear to be of the form du/u
may be manipulated into that form.  In particular, this approach allows
us to integrate powers of tangent and secant more easily.*

**3.1.5 Rational Functions and Integration with Partial Fractions**

*You first learned about partial fractions in precalculus, when you
learned to re-write the quotient of two rational functions when the
denominator function can be written as the product of smaller factors. 
Here, we use these methods to split apart a complicated fraction into
the sum of simpler fractions – in particular, fractions we know how to
integrate.*  
  
 *Polynomial factoring and long division will be used in this

**3.2 Integration with Tables & CAS (Computer Algebra Systems)** <span
id="3.2"></span> 
*In theory, one could use the techniques we have learned so far to
integrate any integrable function.  However, using tables allows us to
avoid “reinventing the wheel” and re-deriving the techniques for more
complicated but standard integrands by summarizing the results of the
process.*

     Instructions: Please click the link above and read this entire
    section.  In this section, Professor Dawkins gives some helpful
    hints about using integral tables to compute integrals quickly; this
    involves reducing whatever problem you are faced with to a problem
    in the tables*. * He bases his discussion on the tables in the
    textbook used by his classes.  However, it is easy to find tables of
    integrals on the Internet; we list several at the end of this
    page.

**3.3 Numerical Integration** <span id="3.3"></span> 
*With numerical integration, we abandon the antiderivative and work with
modifications of the Riemann sum.  This is possible to do for any
integrand, whereas antiderivatives do not exist for every integrand.  In
most cases, we may also compute an error bound, allowing us to
approximate the definite integral to any degree of accuracy we like
(provided we have time to carry out all of the computations).*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read Section 4.6
    in its entirety (pages 224 through 233).  In MA101, we used this
    text to introduce the trapezoidal rule.  You will review that method
    for numerical integration and also learn about Simpson’s Rule in
    this reading.  These approximation methods are used by mathematical
    software to calculate the values of definite integrals to very high
    degrees of accuracy.

**3.4 Improper Integrals** <span id="3.4"></span> 
*In previous integration examples, we have either ignored the domain of
the function (i.e. antiderivatives) or integrated over an interval
without any discontinuities.  But what if we want to integrate over an
interval tending toward infinity, or what if we want to find the area
under a curve on an interval with a vertical asymptote?  This subunit
will introduce you to these integrals, which we refer to as “improper
integrals.”*

     Instructions: This reading will cover sub-subunits 3.4.1 and
    3.4.2.  Please click the link above, and read this entire section.
     The two types of improper integrals are Type I, those with
    “infinite” limits of integration, and Type II, those where the
    integrand has infinite discontinuities somewhere in the interval of
    integration.  Professor Dawkins does not use this terminology,
    although it is common, but he does discuss how to deal with each
    type of improper integral.
