**Unit 2: Applications of Integration** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, we will take a first look at how integration can and has
been used to solve various types of problems.  Now that you have
conceptualized the relationship between integration and areas and
distances, you are ready to take a closer look at various applications;
these range from basic geometric identities to more advanced situations
in Physics and Engineering.*

-   Find the volumes of solids using ideas from geometry.
-   Find the volumes of solids of revolution using disks and washers.
-   Find the volumes of solids of revolution using shells.
-   Write and interpret a parameterization for a curve.
-   Find the length of a curve.
-   Find the surface area of a solid of revolution.
-   Compute the average value of a function.
-   Use integrals to compute the displacement and the total distance
    traveled.
-   Use integrals to compute moments and centers of mass.
-   Use integrals to compute work.

**2.1 The Area between Curves** <span id="2.1"></span> 
*Suppose you want to find the area between two concentric circles.  How
would you do this?  Logic dictates that you subtract the area of the
smaller circle from that of the larger circle.  As this subunit will
demonstrate, this method also works when you are trying to determine the
area between curves.*

**2.2 Volumes of Solids** <span id="2.2"></span> 
*We often take basic geometric formulas for granted.  (Have you ever
asked yourself why the volume of a right cylinder is
V=πhr<sup>2</sup>?)  In this subunit, we will explore how some of these
formulas were developed.  The key lies in viewing solids as functions
that revolve around certain lines.  Consider, for example, a constant,
horizontal line, and then imagine that line revolving around the x-axis
(or any parallel line).  The resulting shape is a right cylinder.  We
can find the volume of this figure by looking at infinitesimally thin
“slices” and adding them all together.  This concept enables us to
calculate the volume of some extremely complex figures.  In this
subunit, we will learn how to do this in general; in the next, we will
now take a look at two conventional methods for doing so when the figure
has rotational symmetry.*

**2.3 Volume of Solids of Revolution** <span id="2.3"></span> 
*When we are presented with a solid that was produced by rotating a
curve around an axis, there are two sensible ways to take that solid
apart: slice it thinly perpendicularly to the axis, into disks (or
washers, if the solid had a hole in the middle), or peel layers from
around the outside like the paper wrapper of a crayon.  The latter
method is known as the shell method and produces thin cylinders.  In
both cases, we find the area of the thin segments and add them up to
find the volume; as usual, when we have infinitely many pieces, this
“addition” is really integration.*

**2.4 Lengths of Curves** <span id="2.4"></span> 
*In this subunit, we will make use of another concept that you have
known and understood for quite some time: the distance formula.  If you
want to estimate the length of a curve on a certain interval, you can
simply calculate the distance between the initial point and terminal
point using the traditional formula.  If you want to increase the
accuracy of this measurement, you can identify a third point in the
middle and calculate the sum of the two resulting distances.  As we add
more points to the formula, our accuracy increases: the exact length of
the curve will be the sum (i.e. the integral) of the infinitesimally
small distances.*

**2.5 Surface Areas of Solids** <span id="2.5"></span> 
*In this subunit, we will combine what we learned earlier in this unit.
 Though you might expect that calculating the surface area of a solid
will be as easy as finding its volume, it actually requires a number of
additional steps.  You will need to find the curve-length for each of
the “slices” we identified earlier and then add them together. *

**2.6 Average Value of Functions** <span id="2.6"></span> 
*Note: You probably learned about averages (or mean values) quite some
time ago.  When you have a finite number of numerical values, you add
them together and divide by the number of values you have added.  There
is nothing preventing us from seeking the average of an infinite number
of values (i.e. a function over a given interval).  In fact, the formula
is intuitive: we add the numbers using an integral and divide by the
range.*

**2.7 Physical Applications** <span id="2.7"></span> 
*We will now apply what we have learned about integration to various
aspects of science.  You may know that in physics, we calculate “work”
by multiplying the force of the work by the distance over which it is
exerted.  You may also know that density is related to mass and volume. 
But we now know that distance and volume are very much related to
integration.  In this subunit, we will explore these and other
connections.*
