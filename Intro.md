This course is the second installment of Single-Variable Calculus. In
Part I [(MA101)](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma101/), we studied
limits, derivatives, and basic integrals as a means to understand the
behavior of functions. In this course (Part II), we will extend our
differentiation and integration abilities and apply the techniques we
have learned. Additional integration techniques, in particular, are a
major part of the course. In Part I, we learned how to integrate by
various formulas and by reversing the chain rule through the technique
of substitution. In Part II, we will learn some clever uses of
substitution, how to reverse the product rule for differentiation
through a technique called integration by parts, and how to rewrite
trigonometric and rational integrands that look impossible into simpler
forms. Series, while a major topic in their own right, also serve to
extend our integration reach: they culminate in an application that lets
you integrate almost any function you’d like. Integration allows us to
calculate physical quantities for complicated objects: the length of a
squiggly line, the volume of clay used to make a decorative vase, or the
center of mass of a tray with variable thickness. The techniques and
applications in this course also set the stage for more complicated
physics concepts related to flow, whether of liquid or energy, addressed
in Multivariable Calculus
[(MA103)](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma103/). Part I covered several
applications of differentiation, including related rates. In Part II, we
introduce differential equations, wherein various rates of change have a
relationship to each other given by an equation. Unlike with related
rates, the rates of change in a differential equation are various-degree
derivatives of a function, including the function itself. For example,
acceleration is the derivative of velocity, but the effect of air
resistance on acceleration is a function of velocity: the faster you
move, the more the air pushes back to slow you down. That relationship
is a differential equation.

### Course Information

Welcome to MA102 Single-Variable Calculus II. Below, please find general
information on this course and its requirements. Picking up where MA101
left off, this course looks at integration in more depth, before moving
on to cover a variety of topics, including parametric equations,
sequences and series, and the basics of ordinary differential equations.
Calculus II can often feel like an ill-assorted grab-bag, but each of
the disparate topics it introduces either extends the reach of our
integration and differentiation techniques or addresses applications of
those techniques.  
  
 **Course Designer:** Clare Wickman  
  
 **Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   University of Michigan: Scholarly Monograph Series: Wilfred Kaplan
    and Donald J. Lewis’s [Calculus and Linear Algebra Vol.
    1](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/s/spobooks/5597602.0001.001/1:2.10?view=toc)
-   University of Wisconsin: H. Jerome Keisler’s [Elementary
    Calculus](http://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/calc.html)
-   Whitman College: Professor David Guichard’s
    [Calculus](http://www.whitman.edu/mathematics/calculus/)
-   University of Houston: Dr. Selwyn Hollis’s [“Video
    Calculus”](http://online.math.uh.edu/HoustonACT/videocalculus/index.html)
-   MIT: Professor Jerison’s [Single Variable
    Calculus](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/)
-   Temple University: Gerardo Mendoza and Dan Reich’s [Calculus on the
    Web](http://www.math.temple.edu/~cow/)
-   Clinton Community College: Elizabeth Wood’s [“Supplemental Notes for
    Calculus
    II”](http://faculty.eicc.edu/bwood/ma155supplemental/supplementalma155.html)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
You will also need to complete:  

-   Unit 1 Assessments
-   Unit 2 Assessments
-   Unit 3 Assessments
-   Unit 4 Assessments
-   Unit 5 Assessments
-   Unit 6 Assessments
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all of the resources and assessments in each unit.  
  
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you approximately **125
hours** to complete. At the beginning of each unit, there is a detailed
list of time advisories for each subunit. These estimates factor in the
time required to watch each lecture, work through each reading
thoughtfully, and complete each assessment. However, these should be
seen as guidelines, not goals; each learner is different, and you may
find that your pace changes throughout the course. Mastery of the
material, rather than strict adherence to the time estimates, is the
measure of success in this course. It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories, to determine how much time you have over the next
few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for yourself. For
example, Unit 1 should take approximately 20.25 hours. Perhaps you can
sit down with your calendar and decide to complete sub-subunit 1.1.1 (a
total of 2 hours) on Monday night; sub-subunits 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 (a total
of 3.5 hours) on Tuesday night; sub-subunit 1.1.4 (a total of 4 hours)
on Wednesday night; etc.  
  
 **Tips/Suggestions: **If a lecture stops making sense to you, pause
it – this is a luxury you only have in a course of this nature! – and
return to the readings to get up-to-speed on the material. Remember to
note down the time at which you paused the lecture, in case your browser
times out. As noted in the “Course Requirements,” Single-variable
Calculus Part I (MA101) is a pre-requisite for this course. If you are
struggling with the mathematics as you progress through this course,
consider taking a break to revisit
[MA101](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma101/).
