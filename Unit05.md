**Unit 5: Infinite Sequences and Series** <span id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, you will become acquainted with the infinite lists called
sequences and infinite sums called series.  The main question for each
is whether it converges: do the terms of the sequence have a finite
limit?  Do the series terms have a finite sum?  You will learn ways to
test for convergence or divergence.  After learning a number of such
tests, we will look at Taylor series, which are infinite polynomials. 
Any function that may be differentiated an unlimited number of times
gives rise to a Taylor series, whose partial sums are approximations to
the function using ever higher-order derivatives.  We will consider
questions like: for which values of the variable does the series
converge?  For those values, is it equal to the function from which it
was defined?  
  
 Many students find series the most difficult of the topics in Calculus
II.  There are multiple expositions of each topic included in this unit,
so be patient with yourself and study each resource carefully.*

**5.2 Series** <span id="5.2"></span> 
*A series is the sum of the terms in an infinite sequence.  You are
likely familiar with series arranged in an arithmetic or geometric
progression; this subunit will take a look at terms defined by more
intricate functions.  You can also view a series as another type of
sequence – a sequence of partial sums.  In the following readings, you
will learn what it means for a series to converge and study some
important types of series.*

**5.2.3 Focus on the Geometric Series** <span id="5.2.3"></span> 
*A series is geometric if every successive term is the product of the
previous term with a fixed value called the ratio of the series.  For
example, 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + ... is a geometric series with ratio 2. 
Geometric series are unusual in that not only can we easily determine
convergence or divergence for them, but in the case of convergence, we
can also find the sum of the series exactly.*

**5.2.4 Highlight: The Binomial Series** <span id="5.2.4"></span> 
*If you wish to expand (1 + x)<sup>2</sup> or (1 + x)<sup>3</sup>, you
may simply multiply them out.  But what are the coefficients of the
fifteen terms in the expansion of (1 + x)<sup>14</sup>?  The binomial
theorem provides an answer in terms of combinations, also known as
binomial coefficients.  The binomial series takes this even a step
further, allowing the expansion of expressions such as 1/(1 + x) and
(1 + x)<sup>1/2</sup> to infinite polynomials.*

    Notes: Calculus II: “Sequences and Series: Binomial Series”**
    Link: Lamar University: Paul Dawkins’s *Paul’s Online Math Notes:
    Calculus II*: “[Sequences and Series: Binomial
    Series](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/BinomialSeries.aspx)” (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click the link above, and read this entire
    section.  Recall that combinations arise from the problem of
    counting subsets of a collection of objects: the number of ways to
    choose two of the four letters ABCD is the combination 4 choose 2,
    which is 6.  If you have not seen it before, the connection to
    powers of binomials may not be clear.  To expand (1 +
    *x*)<sup>2</sup>, you write it as two copies of 1 + *x* and multiply
    one term from the first copy by one term from the second copy, using
    every possible pairing exactly once.  Likewise, to expand (1 +
    *x*)<sup>4</sup>, you must multiply across the four copies of (1 +
    *x*), taking every possible quartet exactly once: all the 1’s, the
    first two 1’s and the last two *x’*s, the first two *x*’s and the
    last two 1’s, etc.  Combinations allow you to find the coefficients,
    because, for example, the coefficient of *x*<sup>2</sup> in the
    expansion of (1 + *x*)<sup>4</sup> is 6: the number of quartets that
    contain exactly two *x*’s, or in other words the number of ways to
    select the two copies of (1 + *x*) that provide the *x*’s.  
      
     The combination *k* choose *n* is typically written as the fraction
    (*k*!)/(*n*!(*k*-*n*)!).  Professor Dawkins writes it the way he
    does so it will generalize to negative and non-integer values of
    *k*.  
      
     Studying this reading should take approximately 30 minutes.

**5.3 Test for Convergence of Positive Series** <span id="5.3"></span> 
*You will first learn how to check when a series with only positive
terms converges – i.e. the* ***limit ****of its* ***sequence of partial
sums ****exists and is finite.  The theory begins here with* ***positive
series****, because it is the simplest problem to consider; these tests
often work by “squeezing” the partial sums between zero and some larger
series which are known to converge.*  
  
 *It is important to notice many of the tests related to series are
one-directional implications: for example, if the series terms do not
limit to zero, you can conclude the series diverges.  However, if it
lacks that property, then you need more information to conclude either
convergence or divergence.  Be careful not to assume a lack of one
conclusion implies the opposite conclusion.*

**5.3.1 Divergence Test** <span id="5.3.1"></span> 
*Convergence of a series is convergence of its sequence of partial
sums.  That is, for the series to converge, the partial sums must settle
down and overall get closer and closer to a fixed finite value.  In
order for that to happen, the amount being added to each partial sum to
produce the next one must gradually shrink away to nothing.  That is the
idea of the divergence test, which applies to any series (not just those
with all positive terms): if the limit of the terms of the series is not
zero, the series diverges.*  
  
 *This is not an equivalence, however!  Many divergent series have terms
that limit to zero.  The terms must shrink to zero rapidly to give
convergence.  However, whether the terms shrink to zero at all is
straightforward to check and may save you work making more complicated
tests on a divergent series.*

**5.3.3 Comparison Test** <span id="5.3.3"></span> 
*Series with no negative terms either have terms that get small enough
or fast enough for the series to converge, or terms that remain too
large and hence cause the series to diverge.  It would seem logical that
if Series A converges, and the n<sup>th</sup> term of Series B is less
than or equal to the n<sup>th</sup> term of Series A for all n (at least
after a finite number of terms), then Series B should converge: if A’s
terms are small enough, B’s should also be.  Likewise, a series with
terms that are larger than the corresponding terms of a divergent series
should diverge.  This is true and is known as the (direct) comparison
test.  *

**5.3.4 Ratio Test** <span id="5.3.4"></span> 
*The ratio and root tests are two ways of checking whether a series is
“geometric in the limit” and thereby drawing conclusions about its
behavior.  The geometric series with terms ar<sup>n</sup>, a and r
positive, has the properties that the ratio of the n+1<sup>st</sup> term
to the nth term is always r, and the n<sup>th</sup> root of the
n<sup>th</sup> term is always r times the n<sup>th</sup> root of a.  The
limit of each of those values as n tends to infinity is r.  The ratio
test and root test check the limits of those values as computed from
other series.  Although we lose some precision – i.e., a geometric
series with ratio 1 diverges, but a limit of 1 in the ratio or root test
is inconclusive – these tests greatly increase the number of series for
which we can determine convergence or divergence.  Typically, only one
of these tests is algebraically feasible for a given series, but in the
event both are, note that if one is inconclusive, the other will be as
well.*

**5.4 Tests for Absolute and Conditional Convergence** <span
id="5.4"></span> 
*Thus far, we have worked with series with all non-negative terms.  When
series with negative terms are allowed, the picture changes slightly. 
If all terms are negative, of course, the series is simply -1 times a
series of all positive terms and has the same convergence behavior as
the positive series.  If the terms are mixed sign, however, the positive
and negative terms cancel each other out to some degree.  For such
series, we have essentially two options: the alternating series test,
which requires the signs alternate, or to take the absolute value of
each term and test that series for convergence.*

**5.4.1 Alternating Series Test** <span id="5.4.1"></span> 
*An alternating series is one in which the terms alternate between
positive and negative.  You may view it as a sequence of partial sums
that alternately increase and decrease.  The alternating series test
says that if the magnitudes of the terms decrease to zero in the limit,
then the series converges.  For example, if every increase or decrease
of the partial sums is smaller than the previous, and they limit to
zero, the partial sums themselves have a finite limit.  Alternating
series that are easy to write down tend either to diverge by the
divergence test or converge by the alternating series test, but be aware
that it is easy to define an alternating series with terms limiting to
zero (but not decreasing to zero) that diverges.  For example, 1 −1/2 +
2/3 −1/3 + 1/2 −1/4 + ….  This is the harmonic series in disguise, as
you will see if you pair off each positive term with the negative term
following it.*

**5.4.2 Definition of Absolute and Conditional Convergence** <span
id="5.4.2"></span> 
*As we have seen with the harmonic and alternating harmonic series, the
cancellation effect of a mixture of positive and negative terms can be
vital for the convergence of a series.  The alternating harmonic is
called a conditionally convergent series: its convergence is conditional
on the cancellation effect.  If it is possible to eliminate the
cancellation (by taking the absolute value of each term) and still have
convergence, the series is called absolutely convergent.  When series
have a mixture of positive and negative terms but do not alternate sign,
taking the absolute value of the terms and testing the resulting series
for convergence is often a good method.  It cannot tell you if the
original series diverges, but it can show if the original series
converges, absolutely.*

    changed.  This is an example of the fact that infinity is a strange
    place.

**5.5 Series Representations of Functions** <span id="5.5"></span> 
*In Single-Variable Calculus I (MA101), we learned that we can
approximate a function about a point when we have information about the
function’s value and its slope at that point.  In this subunit, you will
learn how to be even more accurate by gathering additional information
about the function at a particular point (i.e. by using the second
derivative, third derivative, fourth derivative, etc.).  The more
information you collect, the closer you will get to the function
itself.  The series representation of a function is the infinite series
about a point, taking into consideration all of the derivatives about
that point and in the form of a polynomial.  This will enable us to look
at functions, derivatives, and integrals in new and rather intuitive
ways.*

**5.5.1 Power Series** <span id="5.5.1"></span> 
*A power series is any series where the n<sup>th</sup> term contains
x<sup>n</sup> (where x as the name of the variable and the exact
matching of the term index with the exponent are not essential). 
Essentially, it is an infinite polynomial in x.*

**5.5.2 Calculus with Power Series** <span id="5.5.2"></span> 
*Happily, our infinite polynomials interact with integration and
differentiation in the same way as finite polynomials: the integral of a
sum is the sum of the integrals of each term, and likewise for
derivatives.  The bookkeeping aspects of this topic will be easier if
you think of the “point of view” of the mathematical operators: the
integral sign and derivative operator d/dx see x as a variable and n as
a constant (a different fixed value for each series term).  On the other
hand, the summation operator sees n as the variable and x as the
constant (a value that will be the same for every series term).*

     Under certain conditions, power series can be differentiated and
    integrated.  Certain characteristics of the series may change,
    however, such as the interval of convergence.  We have not been
    using Keisler’s text so far this unit, because hyperreals are not as
    helpful to the intuition for series as they are for integrals.  In
    the last several sub-subunits, they do not appear except in the
    proof of Theorem 1, part (iii), on pages 537-538 of this section. 
    That statement, that the radius of convergence remains the same when
    a power series is integrated or differentiated, is typically given
    in calculus texts without proof.  Do not fret too much over the
    proof.

**5.5.3 Taylor and Maclaurin Series** <span id="5.5.3"></span> 
*Taylor series are a particular kind of power series, defined from a
function.  Maclaurin series are a particular kind of Taylor series.  The
definition allows you to expand any function into an infinite
polynomial, which in many cases will be provably equal to the original
function, and may be much easier to compute with.*

     Taylor Series use the information provided by the derivatives of a
    function (slope of the tangent line, concavity, etc.) to approximate
    the function by a sequence of polynomials.  Taylor’s Theorem tells
    how good this approximation is.  Taylor Series are used extensively
    in higher mathematics, especially in numerical analysis.
