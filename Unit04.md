title: "MA102: Single-Variable Calculus II"
course_description: "In this course, the main focus is on five types of functions: linear, polynomial, rational, exponential, and logarithmic. In accompaniment with these functions, you will learn how to solve equations and inequalities, graph, find domains and ranges, combine functions, and solve a multitude of real-world applications."

**Unit 4: Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates** <span
id="4"></span> 
*So far we have worked in Cartesian (rectangular) coordinates where
there has been one dependent variable, say x, and one dependent variable
y=f(x).  At times this has been inconvenient.  Think about the equation
describing the graph of a circle, x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> =
r<sup>2</sup>: here, y cannot be given as an explicit function of x. 
For situations like this one there are other ways of describing graphs
which make calculations much simpler.*  
  
 *You studied parametric equations and polar coordinates in subunits 4.2
and 4.5 of Precalculus II*
[(MA003)](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma003/)*, so for an alternate
approach, you may review those subunits.  Make sure to come back to this
unit, because MA003 does not cover as much material.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 12.5 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 4.1: 3.5 hours

☐    Subunit 4.2: 4 hours

☐    Reading: 0.75 hours  
  
 ☐    Lecture: 0.75 hours  
  
 ☐    Assessment: 2.5 hours

☐    Subunit 4.3: 2.5 hours

☐    Subunit 4.4: 1.25 hours

☐    Subunit 4.5: 1.25 hours

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Graph parametric equations.
-   Find derivatives of parametric equations.
-   Convert between Cartesian and polar coordinates.
-   Graph equations in polar coordinates.
-   Compute derivatives of equations in polar coordinates.
-   Compute areas under curves described by polar coordinates.
-   Compute arc length for curves given in polar coordinates.

**4.1 Parametric Equations and Their Derivatives** <span
id="4.1"></span> 
*Parametric equations treat x and y each as functions of a third
variable, typically t.  It is helpful to think of t as time, and the
equations as instructing how a curve is to be drawn, giving the pen’s
coordinates for each point in time.  This easily extends to curves in
three-dimensional space by adding an equation for z as a function of t.*

**4.2 Polar Coordinates** <span id="4.2"></span> 
*Note: Polar Coordinates are both a different coordinate system to
describe two-dimensional space and, when related back to the “x-y
plane,” a different parameterization for curves in that system.  Instead
of representing location by horizontal and vertical distance from the
origin, we represent it by straight-line distance from the origin and
angle from the positive x-axis (measured counter-clockwise).*
