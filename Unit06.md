**Unit 6: Differential Equations** <span id="6"></span> 
*This final unit will introduce the relationship between the
mathematical machinery we have been developing and mathematical
modeling.  In practical situations, you will rarely have all of the
information or data needed to represent an initial function.  You will
likely only have information about how the data changes.   In this unit,
you will learn how to apply what we know about functions and how they
behave in order to model and interpret data.*

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Recognize a first order differential equation.
-   Recognize an initial value problem.
-   Solve a first order ODE/IVP using separation of variables.
-   Draw a slope field given an ODE.
-   Use Euler’s method to approximate solutions to basic ODE.
-   Apply basic solution techniques for linear, first order ODE to
    problems involving exponential growth and decay, logistic growth,
    radioactive decay, compound interest, epidemiology, and Newton’s Law
    of Cooling.

**6.1 First-Order Differential Equations** <span id="6.1"></span> 
*A differential equation represents the relationship between an unknown
function and its various higher-order derivatives.  The order of the
relationship is defined by the highest-ordered derivative in the
equation.  In this subunit, we will only study equations involving an
unknown function and its first derivative.  We will leave higher-ordered
differential equations for later courses.*

**6.2 Separation of Variables and Initial Value Problems** <span
id="6.2"></span> 
*Note: Separation of variables is a method for solving certain types of
differential equations.  It is based on the assumption that we can
“separate” our equation into two pieces: a function of the independent
variable and a function of the dependent variable, with no occurrences
of one in the other.*

**6.3 Slope Fields & Euler's Method** <span id="6.3"></span> 
*Recall that antiderivatives of functions are not unique; they differ
from one another by constants.  Thus, initial values are very important
in determining solutions of differential equations.  Slope fields, also
called direction fields, are a way to capture the behavior of a whole
family of solutions to a particular differential equation with different
initial conditions.  Euler’s Method is a way to approximate solutions to
differential equations numerically; it is similar in flavor to Newton’s
Method.*

**6.4 Exponential and Logistic Growth and Applications** <span
id="6.4"></span> 
*A kind of bacteria might have the property where, given sufficient
space, every individual produces one additional individual once an hour,
so the population of bacteria doubles every hour.  If the bacteria are
in a petri dish, however, there are space limitations, and the bacteria
may reproduce once per hour at first but taper off dramatically as the
population grows close to filling the available space.  An exponential
function describes the former situation, and a logistic function
describes the latter situation; such functions may also describe
population decreases.  The list of possible applications is long,
including the decay of radioactive material, the temperature of melting
ice or cooling coffee, the number of people who have heard a rumor, and
the accrual of interest in a bank account.*
