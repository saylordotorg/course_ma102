title: "MA102: Single-Variable Calculus II"
course_description: "In this course, the main focus is on five types of functions: linear, polynomial, rational, exponential, and logarithmic. In accompaniment with these functions, you will learn how to solve equations and inequalities, graph, find domains and ranges, combine functions, and solve a multitude of real-world applications."

**Unit 1: The Integral** <span id="1"></span> 
*We will begin by quickly reviewing the basics of integration, so
integration is fresh in your mind before we extend its applications.
 Having completed MA101, you should be familiar with this material. We
will then take a look at how integration applies to concepts like
motion.  Finally, we will discuss how logarithmic and exponential
functions are integrated.*

     How does one “undo” differentiation?  There are a few
    considerations.  We need to loosely define “elementary function” to
    mean a function put together from rational and trigonometric
    functions, exponentials, radicals, and so forth.  Although the
    derivative of an elementary function always is elementary, there are
    elementary functions with no elementary antiderivative.  Since the
    derivative of a constant is 0, two functions that differ only by an
    added constant term will have the same derivative, so
    antiderivatives are never unique.  However, these limitations do not
    forbid us from developing a strong theory of antidifferentiation,
    introduced in the readings linked above.

     Instructions:  Please click on the link above, and read Section 4.1
    in its entirety (pages 175 through 185).  
      
     This is a slightly different presentation of definite integrals and
    area from the one chosen for MA101.  The author approaches limits
    using the idea of rigorously defined *infinitesimals*, which you may
    think of as infinitely small numbers.  These ultimately give a
    fairly intuitive theory, but you will need some vocabulary, because
    it is not the typical presentation.  An *infinitesimal* is a number
    strictly between −a and a, for every positive real a.  The only real
    infinitesimal is 0; more appear when we use the *hyperreals*, which
    are a collection of numbers extending the reals.  There are non-real
    hyperreals between any two reals: for example, if ε is a positive
    infinitesimal, 5+ε is a non-real hyperreal between 5 and 6 (or even
    5 and 5.00000001).  The *standard part* of a hyperreal is obtained
    by “rounding to the nearest real,” so the standard parts of 5+ε and
    5−ε are both 5, and the standard part of ε by itself is 0.  Division
    by a nonzero infinitesimal gives an infinite hyperreal, a hyperreal
    that is strictly larger than any real number.  The author is careful
    in the text to confirm the calculations give *finite* hyperreals. 
    Infinite hyperreals have no standard part.  The sum of two
    infinitesimals is always infinitesimal, as is the product of an
    infinitesimal and any finite hyperreal number.  
      
     The *Transfer Principle* states that any mathematical statement
    true of a function on the reals is also true of that function’s
    natural extension to the hyperreals.  For example, the fact that
    (x + y)<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>2</sup> + 2xy + y<sup>2</sup> holds for
    all real x and y means it also holds for all hyperreal x and y.  The
    proof of this principle is not important for our purposes, but the
    principle itself is vital.  Finally, a *hyperinteger* is the integer
    analog to a hyperreal.  However, the only finite hyperintegers are
    the integers, so you may think of the hyperintegers as an extension
    of the integers into infinity.

**1.1.4 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** <span id="1.1.4"></span> 
*The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is a two part statement relating
definite integrals to derivatives and antiderivatives.  First, it says
that integrating f(t) from a to x and then differentiating results in
f(x).  Second, it says that definite integrals may be calculated via
antiderivatives.  It is important, because first, it says the
relationship between integration and differentiation is what it ought to
be, and second, that we can evaluate definite integrals without always
resorting to limits of Riemann sums.*

**1.1.6 Integration by Substitution (Change of Variables)** <span
id="1.1.6"></span> 
*The derivative of f(g(x)), by the chain rule, is f’(g(x))\*g’(x).  If
presented with the latter expression as our integrand, we should get
f(g(x)) back as the integral.  However, it can be difficult to determine
what f and g are at a glance.  Substitution “cleans up” the integrand by
hiding g(x) inside a new variable u, and combining g’(x) and dx into
du.  It may also be used to turn a root into a power: let u equal the
radical, solve for x, then differentiate, and plug the result in for
dx.  We will later see other uses of substitution, but all are designed
to rewrite the problem into a form where the method of integration is
clear.*

**1.2 Integration of Transcendental Functions** <span id="1.2"></span> 
*A transcendental number is a number that is not the root of any integer
polynomial.  A transcendental function, similarly, is a function that
cannot be written using roots and the arithmetic found in polynomials. 
We address exponential, logarithmic, and hyperbolic functions here,
having covered the integration and differentiation of trigonometric
functions previously.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read Section 8.3
    in its entirety (pages 441 through 447).  This chapter recaps the
    definition of the number e and the exponential function and its
    behavior under differentiation and integration.

    Natural Logarithmic
    Function](http://online.math.uh.edu/HoustonACT/videocalculus/index.html)” (QuickTime)
    and “[The Exponential
    Function](http://online.math.uh.edu/HoustonACT/videocalculus/index.html)” (QuickTime)  
      
     Instructions: These lectures will cover sub-subunits 1.2.1 and
    1.2.2.  Please watch these two video lectures *AFTER* doing the
    readings for 1.2.1 and 1.2.2.  Click on the first link, scroll down
    to Video 31: “The Natural Logarithmic Function,” and watch the
    presentation through the 5<sup>th</sup> slide (marked 5 of 8). 
    Next, click on the second link above, and scroll down to Video 32:
    “The Exponential Function.”  Choose the format that is most
    appropriate for your Internet connection, and listen to the entire
    21 minute video lecture.  
      
     The first short video gives one definition of the natural logarithm
    and derives all the properties of the natural log from that
    definition.  It does a number of examples of limits, curve
    sketching, differentiation, and integration using the natural log. 
    We will return to this video later to watch the last three slides. 
    The second video explains the number e, the exponential function and
    its derivative and antiderivative, curve sketching using the
    exponential function, and how to perform similar operations on power
    functions with other bases using the change of base formula.  
      
     Viewing these lectures and note-taking should take approximately 45
    minutes.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read Section 8.5
    in its entirety (pages 454 through 459).  This chapter reintroduces
    the natural logarithm (the logarithm with base e) and discusses its
    derivative and antiderivative.  Recall that you can use these
    properties of the natural log to extrapolate the same properties for
    logarithms with arbitrary bases by using the change of base
    formula.  
      
     Studying this reading should take approximately 30 minutes.
